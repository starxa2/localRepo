# Normal python file

# git remote add origin <-link->
# This will make the current localRepo "origin" and upload it on the given link

to check which is the origin use "git remote -v"
"git remote -v" is used to check what is the current git repo

to check the current branch 
"git branch"

to change the name of the current branch use
"git branch -M main"

"git push -u origin main"
after using this from the next time you only need to write
"git push"
