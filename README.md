# This is my Local Repo

The general workflow is 
1. Github Repo
2. clone
3. changes
4. add
5. commit
6. push

git branch (to check branch)
git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git checkout <-branch name-> (to navigate)
git checkout -b <-new branch name-> (to create new branch)
git branch -d <-branch name-> (to delete branch)
